# Qabum_WorkingCapital_BackOffice

Qabum™ Working Capital Backoffice is the internal eligibility and reporting UI for Qabum’s ethical working capital advances.  
It is **not** a marketing landing page and **not** a consumer loan product.

This backoffice allows Qabum™ to:

- Evaluate merchants’ eligibility for working capital advances based on historical sales.
- Apply ethical caps on the total take rate per transaction (MDR + Qabum margin + repayment).
- Generate an A4-ready eligibility and decision report (bilingual EN/ES).
- Capture and document final human authorization within a closed digital ecosystem.
